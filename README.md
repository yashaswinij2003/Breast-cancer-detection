Breast Cancer Detection Using CNN 
** Overview
This project implements a diagnostic support system using deep learning techniques to analyze mammographic images.
It classifies images into benign or malignant categories and offers a desktop-based prediction interface built with Tkinter. 
The tool supports early cancer detection and helps reduce subjectivity in manual diagnosis.

** Features
- Intuitive Tkinter GUI for image upload and classification
- Custom CNN model built using TensorFlow/Keras
- Trained on well-annotated mammogram datasets for multi-class classification
- Designed and tested in VS Code; research published in IJSDR (May 2025)

** Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Tkinter
- Visual Studio Code

** Results
- Achieved strong accuracy(96%), precision, and recall on test data
- Performance exceeds baseline CNN models on small-to-moderate dataset sizes

** Publication
Published in IJSDR â€“ Vol. 10, Issue 5, May 2025
